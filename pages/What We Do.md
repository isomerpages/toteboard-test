### Grantmaker
As a broad-based grantmaker, Tote Board works closely with key partners to identify needs and administer grants in six key sectors: Arts & Culture, Community Development, Education, Health, Social Service, and Sports.

Tote Board channels the gaming revenue from Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club, together with the collection of casino entry levy, to support worthy causes in the community. 

We fund projects that align with our three Strategic Outcomes:

Providing equitable opportunities for vulnerable groups 
Fostering a cohesive and caring community
Building a vibrant and liveable home for Singaporeans
Since 1988 Tote Board has approved more than $10 billion in grants, true to our vision Giving Hope and Improving Lives.

### Trusted Partner
We are committed to enabling and supporting the success and growth of our partners. We do this by: 

Investing in longer-term strategic partnerships and providing funding security with flexible, reliable, and sustainable grants. This allows grantees to focus on what they do bestâ€”supporting and improving their communities. 
Working closely with partners and grantees to enhance their performance, relevance and governance, in line with our Strategic Outcomes in order to keep up with the changing grant landscape. 

### Responsible Gaming
The Board holds the legal rights to operate horse racing and totalisators, lotteries (4D, TOTO, Singapore Sweep) as well as sports betting (football and Formula One motor racing). Tote Board exercises governance over Singapore Pools on 4D, TOTO, Singapore Sweep, sports betting and horse betting operations. The Singapore Turf Club (STC), the proprietary club of Tote Board, manages and operates high quality horse racing.

In 2012, Singapore Pools was conferred the highest accolade by the World Lottery Association in recognition of its responsible gambling practices. Singapore Pools is one of the seven operators in Asia-Pacific to achieve this certification. 

### Effective Counter to Illegal Gaming
Responsible gaming is part of our DNA. 

We  uphold our mandate to counter illegal gambling by providing safe, legal and responsible service offerings for people who choose to bet.  Player protection is a key pillar of our business strategy.  We work closely with stakeholders to achieve a balanced regulatory ecosystem.

We are committed to conducting our business in a fair, transparent, and socially responsible way. We want go beyond meeting regulatory expectations to being recognised as a leader in responsible gaming practices.

As the subject matter experts in our domain,  we keep abreast of global trends and international best practices, assessing their applicability for our business practices. We leverage technology and analytics to better understand our customers and competitors. 

Armed with research and data intelligence, we offer strategic insights and work with stakeholders to develop effective strategies to counter illegal gambling.
