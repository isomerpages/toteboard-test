Tote Board is committed to ensuring the highest standard of corporate governance in the Tote Board Group, comprising Tote Board, Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club (STC). The Chairman and Board Members of Tote Board are appointed by the Minister for Finance. They are experienced professionals drawn from both the public and private sectors.

In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the Board sets strategic directions and policies relating to the functions of Tote Board, ensuring that resources are optimally utilised to fulfil the mission of Tote Board.

### AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) of Tote Board includes representatives from the Board of Tote Board, Board of Singapore Pools, and Management Committee of STC. The majority of ARC members have the requisite accounting or financial-related management expertise to discharge their responsibilities and duties.

The ARC assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee internal controls, financial reporting, compliance and risk management. This includes ensuring the adequacy of internal controls and reviewing audit plans, audit reports and audited Tote Board Annual Financial Statements. Besides overseeing accountability and audits, the ARC also provides oversight of the Tote Board Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework through regular risk management reports from the Management.

The ARC has explicit authority to investigate any matter within its terms of reference. It also has full access to, and cooperation of Management. It has direct access to Group Internal Audit (Group IA) and external auditors, with full discretion to invite any Board Member or Management staff to attend its meetings. In addition, the ARC also meets with external auditors and staff of Group IA, without the presence of Management, during the financial year. Reasonable resources are made available to the ARC, enabling it to properly discharge its function and duties.

### ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
 
The Group has established a structured ERM framework to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of strategic and operational policies and activities. The ERM framework, which draws references from ISO 31000 and COSO standards, provides consistent risk management systems and processes across the Group, identifying and managing risks that could impact the Group’s ability to achieve its mission and objectives. The ERM framework also guides the Group towards its desired maturity level of having an integrated approach to balancing risks with corporate strategy and objectives.

The Board of Tote Board, supported by the ARC, exercises overall risk governance and oversight of the ERM framework. The annual risk review and regular risk reporting exercises, facilitated by the risk management function, are carried out by risk owners and Management, with key risks being reviewed and monitored by the ARC and Board. Strategic responses are formulated and monitored to address any risk gaps, and are built into the coming year’s strategy and work planning for the respective entities and Tote Board departments. On an ongoing basis, significant risk-related developments and incidents will also be reported and escalated to the ARC and/or the Board, where necessary.
